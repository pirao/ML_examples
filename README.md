# ML_examples

This repository contains sample code for supervised and unsupervised learning as well as examples for usage of the members of LabTDF (Laboratory of Tribology and Railway Dynamics). Some examples of topics are:

- Anomaly detection in machine data
- Analizing vibration signals in the frequency domain
- Unsupervised learning 
- Supervised learning
- Deep learning (vanilla neural networks)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA and PCA optimal thresholding)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) functions: boxplot, heatmaps, pairplots, etc.
- Feature selection based on univariate and multivariate correlation
